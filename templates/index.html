        “Space is not the final frontier, but the next frontier. Not something to be conquered but to be explored”
        - Neil deGrasse Tyson </br></br>
        Humans have begun pushing the boundaries of exploration into space since the space race to the moon back in the 1970s.
        Today we are at the cusp of the next space race, many companies have been developing new technologies to further enable humans to travel
        and survive in the hostile environments of space.
        Several examples of technologies that have emerged from the research in space travel are
        things such as the Mylar Blanket (Now usually included in some first aid kits) and artificial limbs.
        We want to challenge participants to think of innovative technologies that can house us in the harshness of space, extract resources
        from our surroundings, power our crafts.

        "For all the immediate challenges that we gather to address this week -- terrorism, instability, inequality, disease -- there’s
        one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat
        of a changing climate."
        - Barack Obama </br></br>
        As we move towards a technologically advanced society, climate change proves to be a constant throughout the ages.
        Without proper care for the climate, the rapid proliferation of technologies can quickly break down the very atmosphere that
        has kept us alive for thousands of years.
        However, with the emergence of green technology and clean energy, it now goes to show that revolutionary technology can
        also save the climate while improving
        the quality of life for everyone. For example, we have Tesla Motors, which is both an engineering marvel and pioneer in clean technology.
        In this hackathon, we want to challenge the individuals to create products that have a positive impact on the climate.

        “Education is not preparation for life, education is life itself.”
        - John Dewey</br></br>
        With the global shift towards technology, we understand and see an immense potential for innovation
        in the education sector. Be it via smart classes that make use of AR / VR to drive home important concepts
        in the student’s understanding, or via the Internet, where massively online open courseware (MOOCs) have
        proliferated and made education even more accessible to people worldwide. The urge to provide a robust and
        reliable form of education is being recognized by us as an important cause both now and in the future. With an increasingly
        connected world, we all dream of a day where education will be smart, accessible and readily available
        to anyone, anywhere, whenever they want.
        In this upcoming hackathon, we strive to challenge the participants on developing products which can help to
        improve the education. Be it via countering the idea of misinformation, or simply keeping each other in the
        know of all the latest global happenings, come and play your part!

        “Big Brother is watching you”
        - George Orwell, 1984 </br></br>
        With more digital devices and services permeating into our lives, more of our possessions and identities
        are being stored in the digital realm. Although most innovations are focused on creating these services,
        we should also forge the path for innovative ways to fortify these services too, be it your protecting digital
        devices, your physical IOT devices in our home or simply just having a smart home with smart door locks.
        With critical technologies, such as autonomous cars entering the smart grid and as we move forward in the
        technological era, it is now vital, more than ever, that we foster innovation in safeguarding our futures and our families.
        </br></br>
        In this hackathon, we want to challenge the participants to create solutions that address the issue of security.
        We would like to emphasize that this is not meant to be a technical theme, so it will be up to the participants
        to interpret it in whichever way they want.
